# [DS2.3 - Data Science in Production](https://make-school-courses.github.io/DS-2.3-Data-Science-in-Production/#/)

This course covers the tools and techniques commonly utilized for production machine learning in industry. Students learn how to provide web interfaces for training machine learning or deep learning models with Flask and Docker. Students will deploy models in the cloud through Amazon Web Services (AWS), gather and process data from the web, and display information for consumption in advanced web applications using Plotly and D3.js. Students use PySpark to make querying even the largest data stores manageable.

## Learning Outcomes
Students by the end of the course will be able to:

1. Implement Machine Learning or Deep Learning on a Web App using Flask and Flask-RESTPlus
2. Dockerize the Flask Web App and develop it on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
3. Read large datasets from AWS Simple Storage Services (S3) through the Boto python interface
4. Implement Advanced Visualizations using a Chart.js/D3.js Frontend, and a Python Backend
5. Work on Big Data using PySpark, H2O and Pandas
